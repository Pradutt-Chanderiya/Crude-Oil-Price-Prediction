# Crude-Oil-Price-Prediction
The **Crude Oil Prediction** project focuses on building a robust system capable of predicting crude oil prices using machine learning and time series analysis techniques. With the global economy being heavily dependent on oil prices, predicting future trends is crucial for energy companies, governments, and investors. This project aims to leverage historical data, market trends, and various economic indicators to forecast oil prices with high accuracy.

In this project, historical crude oil prices were analyzed using different time series models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, in combination with machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks). The primary goal is to predict future price movements by understanding the historical patterns and key drivers that influence price fluctuations. This comprehensive approach enables the model to account for various market factors such as supply-demand dynamics, geopolitical tensions, and global financial indicators.

The project includes multiple phases of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. In the data preprocessing stage, I used techniques like handling missing values, feature scaling, and time-series decomposition to clean and structure the data. Feature engineering was crucial for identifying key variables such as inflation, stock market indexes, and economic reports, which were fed into the model.

The results of the model were visualized using advanced data visualization techniques to provide a clear understanding of predicted price movements. I also developed an interactive dashboard that displays real-time oil price predictions, past trends, and key indicators affecting the market.

This project is a comprehensive example of how machine learning and data science techniques can be applied to solve real-world economic problems, providing valuable insights to stakeholders involved in the oil market. The model's predictive capabilities allow for better risk management, more informed decision-making, and improved investment strategies.
